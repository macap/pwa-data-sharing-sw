# PWA Data sharing SW

PoC how to share data between app in safari and standalone mode and use it to implement working oauth solution. Implements Facebook OAuth as an example. 

Plain data sharing available on *data-sharing-example* branch.

## Demo

- branch: *master*

Token is passed directly to frontend so your data is not collected by me in any way.
